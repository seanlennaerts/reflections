=================================
New commands at a glance:

diff -u old_file.js new_file.js
git log
git log --stat
git diff id_old id_nnew
git clone url_of_repo
git checkout id_1
=================================

I learned how to use diff -u old_file.js new_file.js to compare things in terminal. The -u flag stands for universal and makes viewing the files easier.

Continuing with the Git tutorial.
I learned that it is good to commit after each logical change has been made to the code. For example, a bug fix, a new feature that took about an hour.

Learned how to use git log and git log --stat
Learned how to use git diff id_1 id_2

Learned how to use git checkout id_1 : this changes the "head" to commit with the id id_1, so you're reverting to a previous copy of the file. You can go forward in the history as well.

Customize terminal by editing the .bash_profile in the home directory

Staging area: place to add multiple files before commiting
